This repository is for the storage of projects built while I am learning JS/Node JS for back-end development.

JS Básico and JS Objetos are where it all began. They show what there is of most basic regarding JS, mainly studied for getting to know the syntax.

NODEJS-LIB is where I created my first NODE.JS library, paying more attention to good programming practices, such as creating an organized and readable code. I learned more about packages, various JS functions, importing and exporting functions and libraries, JSON files, NPM commands etc.
